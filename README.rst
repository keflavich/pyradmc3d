Python RADMC3D
==============

This is not the first module of it's kind.

[Patrick Sheehan's pspy](https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy/tree/master/radmc3d) includes radmc3d code
[Marc Joos](https://bitbucket.org/mjoos/pyradmc/) has a radmc3d module
[Kevin Sooley](https://github.com/Kevtron/radmc3d-py) wrote one too

Additionally, there are at least a few [one-off scripts](https://github.com/Kevtron/radmc3d-py)

This one is only a little different.  Really, what needs to happen is a merger
of all of these modules into one coherent package...
