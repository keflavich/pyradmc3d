Python RADMC3D
==============

This is not the first module of it's kind.

 * `Patrick Sheehan's pspy <https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy/tree/master/radmc3d>`__ includes radmc3d code
 * `Marc Joos <https://bitbucket.org/mjoos/pyradmc/>`__ has a radmc3d module
 * `Kevin Sooley <https://github.com/Kevtron/radmc3d-py>`__ wrote one too

Additionally, there are at least a few `one-off scripts <https://github.com/Kevtron/radmc3d-py>`__

This one is only a little different.  Really, what needs to happen is a merger
of all of these modules into one coherent package...
